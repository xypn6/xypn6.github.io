        <h4 id="ray_tracing_header">Ray-tracing:</h4>
        <p id="ray_tracing_info">After investigating these current technologies, its time we move of to, in my opinion, the most important advancement in gaming, Real-time Ray Tracing (RRT). Ray-tracing is defined by Wikipedia as “a technique for modelling light transport for
            use in a wide variety of rendering algorithms for generating digital images”. According to Wikipedia, Ray-tracing (RT) has been around since the 16th century, however this was not what we would consider “Ray-tracing” today. RT in computers
            was first accomplished by Arthur Appel in 1968. As stated on Wikipedia, “Appel used ray tracing for primary visibility (determining the closest surface to the camera at each image point), and traced secondary rays to the light source from
            each point being shaded to determine whether the point was in shadow or not.”
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics)" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics)">(Wikipedia, 2022)</a>
            <br>
            <br> Since then, RT has seen much more development. RRT was only recently available in video games, with newer hardware acceleration and graphics APIs. Ray-tracing works by tracing a path from an imaginary eye through each pixel in a virtual
            screen, and calculating the colour of each object visible through it
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics)#Algorithm_overview" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics)#Algorithm_overview">(Wikipedia, 2022)</a> Ray-tracing was very resource-intensive (resources referring
            to available hardware of a device), until September 2018, when NVIDIA released the RTX 20-series. These graphics cards contained the CUDA cores, which with the Maxwell architecture, is capable of 40% efficiency gain over Kepler architecture.
            This finally made ray-tracing widely available to the masses.
            <br>
            <br> Ray-tracing has seen a significant impact on designing games, as game designers are focusing more on lighting. Game developers are having to integrate modern graphics APIs to allow for ray-tracing. Ray-traced graphics are usually softer,
            as seen in this article,
            <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/graphics-cards/133269/what-is-ray-tracing-and-what-it-means-for-pc-gaming" title="https://uk.pcmag.com/graphics-cards/133269/what-is-ray-tracing-and-what-it-means-for-pc-gaming">(pcmag, 2021)</a>. Example images
            show images where ray-tracing is enabled. The shadows have a smoother edge around them and the lighting is visibly softer. In its current state, “theres no imperative to invest in a graphics card that support ray-tracing unless you determine
            the visual difference are worth the money”
        </p>

        <h4 id="console_header">Consoles:</h4>

        <p id="console_info">Consoles are currently a big topic, with the release of the “next generation” of consoles, such as the PS5 and Xbox series-X. They boast “lightning-fast speeds that have never been seen in previous generations”
            <a href="https://whatnerd.com/next-gen-consoles-pros-cons/" title="https://whatnerd.com/next-gen-consoles-pros-cons/">(whatnerd, 2020)</a> . Consoles were the first systems to make games widely available. In 1994, the PlayStation 1 was released.
            It has an incredible 102.49 million units sold
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_(console)" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_(console)" ">(Wikipedia, 2022)</a> This was one of the first consoles to use CD-ROM. While consoles have had a major impact in the gaming industry, they have many drawbacks. One major drawback is
			the feature of “Live services”. Live services refer to a subscription to access online features. While not all consoles feature live services, most do. This is usually between £6.99 to £ 9.99*. Another draw-back of consoles is limited hardware
			and hardware swapping. The hardware within consoles isn't usually the best, however it is optimised to play most games at a certain benchmark level. More drawbacks include: Limited input options, Lack of modding / modding support and limited customisation.
			<br>
			<br> Consoles were very significant, however I predict they’ll become less and less important when developing and designing games as more and more people get desktops or PCs

		<h4 id="ai_header ">Artificial Intelligence - </h4>
		<p id="ai_info ">
			As stated by <a href="https://www.theproche.com/2020/03/17/technology-trends-in-gaming-industry/ " title="https://www.theproche.com/2020/03/17/technology-trends-in-gaming-industry/ ">(theproche, 2020)</a>
			,  the main emerging technology is Artificial Intelligence (AI). While it may be a current technology as well, the improvements we are seeing in recent games is incredible AI is incredibly important in games. It can improve everything in a game, from enemy realism in a first person shooter to opponent difficulty in chess. AI went from being able to point and shoot at the player to trying to use advanced tactics such as flanking the player or falling back. In games such as Arma 3, the AI will be able to choose the better vehicle and gear for a mission based on certain factors, all without user input. One thing I’d like to see implemented in a game is “AI machine learning”. Machine Learning (ML) is defined as “a type of artificial intelligence in which computers use huge amounts of data to learn how to do tasks rather than being programmed to do them”
			<a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/machine-learning " title=" "https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/machine-learning" ">(Oxford, 2021)</a>
			. This would make the AI learn to counter a players strategy, forcing them to use different strategies to overcome an obstacle. This would inevitably lead to AI you can’t beat, but it’d be fun to see an AI slowly get better and better as you play.

        <div class="facial_detection">
            <h3 id="facial_detection_header">Facial Detection:</h3>
            <p id="facial_detection_body">Another, less talked about, emerging technology is facial detection. On paper, it seems like a good idea, as it could lead to better / more accurate in-game characters. However, this is a very slippery slope. As stated in
                <a href="https://xsreviews.co.uk/editorial/risks-of-facial-recognition-in-gaming/ " title="https://xsreviews.co.uk/editorial/risks-of-facial-recognition-in-gaming/ ">(xsreviews, 2020)</a>
                , this could, and has, lead to massive privacy issues. According to the article, “Gaming companies have been forced to install facial recognition systems, and due to a lack of proper security measures, their databases are being sold to e-commerce platforms”. With the advances in technology, advances in security measures and encryption must follow. In most situations, this sadly seems to have been overlooked. In my opinion, including facial recognition in games is unnecessary and steps over the line of “features at the cost of privacy”. This, and it requires the user to have a camera, which for one that could be useable for facial detection, could be as much as £60. Saying this, Facial detection is not without its benefits, even if they are small details. For example, FD can help with immersion as it can put your face on a character, or it can be used for eye tracking, so you needn’t physically move the players view with your mouse. I believe facial recognition will seldom be used in video games and will not have a significant impact on development and design of video games. The main application I could see it being used for is making NPCs in games higher quality, however this would slow down development significantly as it would require game engines to be rewritten, and for this reason I think it wont be very impactful</p>

        <div class="vr">
            <h3 id="vr_header">Virtual Reality:</h3>
            <p>Having researched all these emerging technologies, I believe the most important emerging technology is VR, or Virtual Reality. Google
            <a href="https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803120011837#:~:text=A%20life%2Dlike%20artificial%20environment,architectural%20design%2C%20and%20advanced%20advertising.">(oxfordreference, 2022)</a>
            defines VR as “A life-like artificial environment with various online applications, for example in computer games, simulations for training purposes, virtual tours, animation, architectural designs and advanced advertising”. VR is incredible. It allows the user to feel as if they are physically in the game. As the technology evolves, it becomes increasingly accessible, especially with PSVR, where all you need is the headset and PS4 or later. The technology is incredible, however it is not all good. One of the main drawbacks of VR is the motion sickness. After a while, majority of people start to feel sick and nausea after a couple of hours. It also requires quite a significant investment. The high-end gear can cost upwards of £1000, not including the PC required to run the gear. While Oculus is helping combat this with the Oculus Quest 2
            <a href="https://www.oculus.com/quest-2/">(Oculus, 2021)</a>
            , which starts at £299, this is still out of reach for most gamers. As the popularity of VR increases, developers gain increased incentive to make games for the platform. One of the most popular VR games (as of 12th Jan 2022) is Beat Saber, followed close by, and I cannot believe I am saying this, “Rick & Morty: Virtual Rick-ality”
            Another part of VR is haptic gear. “Haptic” is defined as “used to describe the sense of touch.” Haptic gear is stuff that allows a user to feel things in VR in real-life. An example of this is “bHaptic TactSuit X40”
            <a href="https://www.bhaptics.com/">(Bhaptics, 2021)</a>
            . It has 40 feedback points which allows for high “Haptic resolution”. Haptic suits are currently around £499 for a decent one.
